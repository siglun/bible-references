## Abstract  




## Introduction

Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig is one of the most influential persons in Danish history. He was a polymath and very prolific, a pastor, author, poet, philosopher, historian, teacher and politician, as wikipedia () describes him.

This project includes a statical analysis of his use of bible references, as found in Det Kgl. Bibliotek's (2020) Grundtvigs Værker [https://tekster.kb.dk/](https://tekster.kb.dk/). The Grundtvig data for the portal comes from the [Center for Grundtvigforskning](https://grundtvigcenteret.au.dk/) which is the publisher of [Grundtvigs Værker](http://www.grundtvigsværker.dk/) referred to as GV.

I use the counts of individual bible references to compare all the years of Grundtvig's professional life. The philologists at the Grundtig centre has identified 11499 references to the bible in the GV. They refer to 4637 different locations in the bible, i.e., he uses each location 2.5 times on the average. In reality there are large number of bible locations that just appear once in a reference, whereas there are a number of favourates which is cited 50-60 in the corpus.

What you find below is an outline of my analysis of of his bible references from a technical point of view.
