On Grundtvig and his use of bible references -- Musings of a software developer

Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783-1872) is one of the most
influential persons in Danish 19th century history.  A polymath and
very prolific writer and "a pastor, author, poet, philosopher,
historian, teacher and politician" as Wikipedia describes him. In this
paper I present some data analyses on his use of the bible in his
writing.

Grundtvig's collected works (GV) in TEI contains markup for references
to the Bible. The philologists at the Grundtvig centre has identified
11499 bible references in the GV. They refer to 4637 locations, which
means that Grundtvig referred to each location 2.5 times on the
average.

A majority of his references are only used once or twice, I assume
they are used for some specific purpose. Then there are some five to
ten references (favourites) that he use repeatedly through his career.
There are two different sets of favourites for prose and verse.

Finally, when I compare Grundtvig's bible references through the
years, using a cluster analyses, it turns out that the algorithm
chooses two years 1826 and 1839 as focal points for, respectively,
prose and verse.
